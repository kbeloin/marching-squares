# Marching Squares

This app demonstrates the marching squares algorithm, which generates countours (or boundaries) for a two-dimensional array. In this example, the contours are generated around randomly selected binary values.

## Playing

Playing the app will rapidly generate new fields around which contours are generated.

## Resolution

Lower numbers generates a finer resolution; however, resolutions between 1 - 3 have noticeable impacts on performance.

## Technologies Used

Built in React, this app also provided an opportunity to use 2D canvas and vector graphics. Originally, my approach was to represent the field using DOM-elements, but this had obvious performance limitations.
